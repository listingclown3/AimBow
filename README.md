## AimBot 1.8.9

Credit goes to [Michael Zang](https://github.com/michaelzangl) for the original [Minebot/Aimbow](https://github.com/michaelzangl/minebot/tree/forge-1.8.9/AimBow) project
<br>I simply added to the project with the help of LegoNinja48 and updated the compatibility to 1.8.9

## Features

- 1.8.9 Forge Minecraft functionality
- Graphs the trajectory of projectiles and arrows
- Customizable trajectory colors
- Crosshair fixing (Not really functional?)
- Block distance (Doesn't really work for projectiles but works for the bow)

## Explaining the Math

- Coming soon on my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyjficiLV37wXhT3VBkp0ew)!!!

## Todo
- Add highlighting block position (like a beacon)
- Smart autoaiming (predicts how to hit entity based on its speed, direction, etc)
- More customizability
- Explain the math
- Fix the mcmod.info
- Fix overlay rendering (messes with skyblock mod maps, etc.)
