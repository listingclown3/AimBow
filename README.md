## AimBot 1.8.9

Credit goes to [Michael Zang](https://github.com/michaelzangl) for the original [Minebot/Aimbow](https://github.com/michaelzangl/minebot/tree/forge-1.8.9/AimBow) project
<br>I simply added to the project with the help of LegoNinja48 and updated the compatibility to 1.8.9 (amazing wrapper!)

## Features

- 1.8.9 Forge Minecraft functionality
- Graphs the trajectory of projectiles, arrows, fishing rods, etc.
- Customizable trajectory colors
- Crosshair fixing (Not really functional?)
- Block distance (works sometimes)

## Todo
- Smart autoaiming (predicts how to hit entity based on its speed, direction, etc)
- More customizability
- Explain the math
- Fix the mcmod.info
- Auto EnderClutch
- Auto PotionHeal
- Auto PotionDamage
- Auto FishingHit
- add flashback feature (when in motion save the projectile trajectory until trajectory is complete, that way recorrections can be made)
   * set changeable amount of flashbacks (i.e, 5 predictions can be saved after shooting before the next one is created and the oldest is unrendered)

* splash potion vs bottle o enchanting MIGHT have difference velocity values, etc. is changeable
